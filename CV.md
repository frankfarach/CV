*A Model Integrated Data Management System for Multi-Disciplinary Autism Research*  
This project will empower autism investigators to make more effective use of interdisciplinary research data they collect, and to more efficiently exchange data with the scientific community. We will achieve this goal by creating free (open-source) software that can easily integrate various kinds of data from different studies; no such software currently exists. This software will allow researchers to optimize their use of scarce research dollars, and will help accelerate progress in understanding autism and other mental disorders.

*Optimizing PTSD Treatment (Biomarker Supplement)*  
This study examines biopsychosocial markers of treatment response to either prolonged exposure (PE) therapy or the combination of PE and sertraline among individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder within a doubly randomized treatment preference design. The supplement also supports the sharing of study results through the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).
